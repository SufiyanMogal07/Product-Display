E-Commerce App

Initially started as a simple project displaying product cards, this application was enhanced with comprehensive features using React, Redux, and Redux Thunk. I integrated functionalities such as add-to-cart, remove from cart, and a slide-out popup for easy cart management. The app also supports asynchronous API calls for real-time product data fetching and dynamic updates. This project showcases my ability to evolve a basic concept into a fully functional e-commerce platform with state management and a user-friendly interface.
